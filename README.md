ðŸ“Š Trader Behavior & Market Sentiment Analysis

This project explores the relationship between trader performance (from historical trading data) and Bitcoin market sentiment (Fear/Greed index). It is part of an assignment for a data science role, designed to uncover insights that can inform smarter trading strategies in the crypto ecosystem.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Analyze the relationship between:
Trader Performance: Historical trading data from Hyperliquid, including metrics like PnL, trade size, and trade direction.
Market Sentiment: Bitcoin Fear/Greed Index data, reflecting overall market mood (Fear, Greed, Extreme Fear).
The goal is to extract insights, uncover hidden patterns, and suggest actionable trading strategies based on data-driven analysis.

ðŸ“¦ Deliverables
âœ… Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
Converted timestamps, aligned data formats, and ensured consistency.
Normalized categorical columns for robust analysis.

âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized distributions of PnL, trade size, and trade side (Buy/Sell).
Explored top traders, daily PnL trends, and sentiment classification trends over time.

âœ… Hypothesis Testing
Tested for significant differences in PnL between Buy and Sell trades.

âœ… Advanced Analysis
Performed K-Means Clustering to segment traders based on behavior and outcomes.

âœ… Insights & Recommendations
Summarized key findings and provided actionable strategies for risk management, trade optimization, and future data integration.

âœ… Visualizations
Embedded charts illustrating key patterns and trends.

ðŸ“Š Insights Summary
A small number of traders dominate profits, while many traders face consistent losses.
No significant difference was found between Buy and Sell PnL performance.
Market sentiment cycles through Fear and Greed phases, offering potential signals for strategy adjustments.

ðŸ’¡ Future Work
Integrate real-time sentiment data for time-aligned analysis.
Build predictive models to forecast PnL based on trade behavior and sentiment.
