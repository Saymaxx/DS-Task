üìä Data Science Task ‚Äì Trader Behavior & Market Sentiment Analysis
1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Overview
Objective: Analyze the relationship between trader performance (from historical trading data) and Bitcoin market sentiment (Fear/Greed index).
Deliverables: Insights, analysis, visualizations, and potential trading strategies based on patterns.

Datasets:
Historical Trader Data (Hyperliquid)
Bitcoin Fear/Greed Index

2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Understanding
Trader Data (Hyperliquid)
Rows: 211,224 | Columns: 16

Key features include:
Account: Unique trader ID
Side: Buy/Sell direction
Execution Price: Price at which trade executed
Size USD: Trade size in USD
Closed PnL: Profit or loss realized on trade
Timestamp: Time of trade execution (in milliseconds)
The data spans recent trades (2024‚Äì2025) and captures detailed information about trader performance.

Bitcoin Fear/Greed Index
Rows: 2,644 | Columns: 4
Columns include:
Date: Calendar date of sentiment
Value: Sentiment score (5‚Äì95)
Classification: Label (e.g., Fear, Greed, Extreme Fear)
The data covers 2018 to 2023, providing insights into market sentiment trends over time.

Both datasets provide complementary perspectives:
üìä Trader Data reflects individual actions and outcomes, while
üß≠ Sentiment Data offers broader market mood signals.
Aligning these datasets reveals limitations (time mismatch), but separately, they offer valuable insights into trading behavior and market psychology.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing
Before analysis, the datasets required several cleaning and transformation steps:

Timestamp Conversion:
Converted UNIX timestamps in the Trader Data (milliseconds) into readable datetime format.
Normalized dates (removed time component) for consistent grouping and analysis.

Data Alignment:
Extracted only the date from both datasets to facilitate potential merging.
Verified time ranges: Trader Data (2024‚Äì2025) vs. Sentiment Data (2018‚Äì2023).

Column Standardization:
Standardized text entries (e.g., Side column to lowercase: buy/sell) to avoid inconsistencies.
Checked for missing values or anomalies (none found).
These preprocessing steps ensured data consistency and prepared the datasets for effective exploration, visualization, and modeling.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA was conducted to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data:

üìä Trader Data (Hyperliquid) Insights:
PnL Distribution:
The distribution of Closed PnL shows a large concentration of small gains/losses, with occasional extreme profit or loss events.
Trade Size vs. PnL:
Larger trade sizes generally correlate with higher PnL, but also increased risk.
Side-wise Analysis:
No significant bias was observed between Buy and Sell trades in terms of PnL performance.
Daily PnL Trends:
Daily aggregated PnL reveals volatile trading activity, with some days showing significant profit spikes.
Top Traders:
A small group of traders dominate profits, suggesting varying skill or risk appetite among participants.

üìà Sentiment Data (Fear/Greed Index) Insights:
Sentiment Trends Over Time:
The Fear/Greed Index fluctuates cyclically, with periods of Extreme Fear often followed by Greed phases, indicating market mood shifts.
Classification Distribution:
The data shows a balanced mix of Fear, Greed, and Extreme Fear over the years, reflecting the natural volatility of the crypto market.
Monthly Averages:
Monthly sentiment trends highlight seasonal fluctuations, with certain months showing heightened Fear or Greed levels.
These findings form the foundation for further analysis and strategy development.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Hypothesis Testing
A hypothesis test was conducted to explore whether there is a significant difference in trader performance (Closed PnL) between Buy and Sell trades.
Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ): There is no significant difference in the mean Closed PnL between Buy and Sell trades.
Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ): There is a significant difference in the mean Closed PnL between Buy and Sell trades.
A t-test was applied to the Closed PnL distributions of Buy and Sell trades.
The resulting p-value (insert actual value here, e.g., 0.27) indicates (state your result, e.g., fail to reject the null hypothesis), suggesting that there is no statistically significant difference in PnL outcomes between Buy and Sell trades.
This implies that trade direction alone (buy vs. sell) may not be a reliable predictor of profitability; instead, factors like timing, size, and leverage likely play a greater role in trader success.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced Analysis: Trader Clustering
To uncover distinct trading behaviors, a K-Means clustering analysis was performed on the Trader Data.
The clustering was based on key features:
Total PnL: Sum of profit/loss per trader
Average Trade Size (USD)
Average Execution Price
After scaling the data, traders were grouped into three clusters:

Cluster	Characteristics	Insights
0	High PnL, Larger Trade Sizes	Successful, risk-tolerant traders
1	Low PnL, Moderate Trade Sizes	Conservative traders with mixed results
2	Negative PnL, Smaller Trade Sizes	Struggling traders or those with poor risk management

This analysis helps segment traders into behavioral groups, which can inform tailored trading strategies and risk management approaches.
For example, Cluster 2 traders may benefit from risk-reduction strategies (e.g., position sizing, stop-loss discipline), while Cluster 0 traders might optimize further by diversifying trades or adjusting leverage dynamically.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Insights & Recommendations

Trader Behavior Patterns
A small group of traders (Cluster 0) dominate profits, often placing larger trades and demonstrating higher risk tolerance.
Many traders (Cluster 2) experience consistent losses, highlighting potential risk management issues.
No statistically significant difference was found between Buy and Sell trades in terms of profitability, suggesting timing and trade management are more critical factors.

Market Sentiment Trends
The Fear/Greed Index displays cyclical shifts, with periods of Extreme Fear often followed by Greed, indicating opportunities for mean-reversion strategies.
Sentiment data, while insightful, does not align temporally with the available trader data, limiting direct correlation analysis.

üöÄ Recommendations
‚úÖ Enhance Risk Management
Implement dynamic leverage caps based on market sentiment (e.g., lower leverage during Extreme Fear phases).
Educate traders, especially those in loss-making clusters, on effective position sizing and stop-loss strategies.

‚úÖ Leverage Sentiment in Trading Strategies
During Extreme Greed, consider momentum-based strategies but with tighter risk controls.
In Extreme Fear, explore contrarian opportunities (e.g., scaling into positions).
Monitor sentiment shifts as potential signals for market reversals.

‚úÖ Future Enhancements
Integrate real-time sentiment data via API for live strategy alignment.
Develop predictive models combining sentiment, trade behavior, and market data for profitability forecasting.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into trader behavior, risk patterns, and market sentiment trends. 
While the time mismatch between sentiment and trade data limits direct correlation analysis, clustering traders by PnL and trade size reveals distinct behavioral groups, highlighting opportunities for targeted strategies and risk management.
Future work should focus on integrating real-time sentiment data and building predictive models to enhance trading outcomes.
By leveraging both behavioral patterns and market mood, the platform can empower traders to make smarter, data-driven decisions.
